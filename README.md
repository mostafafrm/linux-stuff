My Linux stuff. I will dump my scripts here. Feel free to criticize my bad practices. I feed on people hating my code! :)

## Automatic setup

Bash usually runs every script you put under `~/.bashrc.d/*` or `~/.bashrc.d/*.sh`.

Run `setup.sh` script to link `bashrc.d` from this repo in `~/.bashrc.d/` in your machine.

```bash
bash setup.sh
```
